Predicting Test Scores with Study and Sleep Time
Problem

I am trying to determine whether a computer can predict a student’s test score based on how long they study and sleep. This matters because it shows how everyday behaviors can be analyzed using AI.

Solution

This project uses a simple machine learning model trained on student data. The model predicts test scores using hours studied and hours slept.

Tools

Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn were used to build and train the model. Google Sheets was used to create the dataset, and GitHub was used to publish the project.

The model successfully predicts test scores with reasonable accuracy. For example, studying 6 hours and sleeping 8 hours predicts a score of about 81.
