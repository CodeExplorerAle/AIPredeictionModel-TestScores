Predicting Test Scores with Study and Sleep Time
Problem

I am trying to determine whether a computer can predict a student’s test score based on how long they study and sleep. This matters because it shows how everyday behaviors can be analyzed using AI.

Solution

This project uses a simple machine learning model trained on student data. The model predicts test scores using hours studied and hours slept.

Tools

Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn were used to build and train the model. Google Sheets was used to create the dataset, and GitHub was used to publish the project.

Results – Output Screenshot

The model successfully predicts test scores with reasonable accuracy. For example, studying 6 hours and sleeping 7 hours predicts a score of about 82.

Learning

I learned how machine learning models learn from data and make predictions. I also learned how data quality affects model accuracy,
