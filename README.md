Can Ia Computer predict a score based on students time studying and sleep?
Problem

Can a computer predict a student’s test score based on how much they study and sleep?
This matters because it shows how real-world factors can be turned into data and used by AI to make predictions. It also demonstrates how machine learning models learn patterns from examples.

Solution

I created a simple machine learning model that learns from past student data.
The model looks at hours studied and hours slept, then predicts a test score. By training the model on existing data, it can make reasonable predictions for new inputs.

Tools

Python

Pandas (data handling)

Scikit-learn (machine learning model)

Google Sheets (creating training data)

GitHub (project publishing)

Results – Output Screenshot

The model successfully predicts test scores based on study and sleep hours.
Predictions are close to real values, showing that even a simple AI model can find patterns in data.

Example:

Studied 6 hours, slept 7 hours → Predicted score: ~82

Learning

I learned how machine learning models are trained using real data, how Python can be used to build AI projects, and how data quality affects prediction accuracy.
